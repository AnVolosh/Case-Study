# Historical Development 
## Late 1800s – First analogues 
Punch cards were developed by Herman Hollerith. They were used in early computers for data input and storage.  
Technology - Punch tape — continuous rolls of paper with holes encoding data. 
IBM later used and marketed punched cards with the iconic phrase “Do not fold, spindle, or mutilate”.

## 1930s–1950s  
Magnetic drum memory — first “reusable” electronic storage medium, precursor to magnetic disks. 
Rotating metal cylinder coated with magnetic material; could be rewritten multiple times. 
Used in early computers such as ERA 1103 and IBM 650.

## 1950s–1970s Magnetic Revolution   
## 1956  
IBM 305 RAMAC —first commercial hard disk drive (HDD); 5 MB capacity, 50 spinning disks, size of a wardrobe.  
Magnetic core memory (ferrite rings) — used in early mainframes; fast but expensive. 
Magnetic tape drives — cheaper, high capacity, sequential access; widely used for backups.

Marketed as “miracle memory”.

## 1970s–1980s Miniaturization & Personal Computing Era  
Floppy disks (8", 5.25", 3.5") — portable, rewritable, symbolic early PCs. 
Compact cassette data storage — used in early home computers like the Commodore 64. 
Early HDD refinements — Winchester drives introduced sealed heads, improved reliability.
Used widely in PCs for software, boot disks, and data storage.
