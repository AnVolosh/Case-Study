# Historical Development 
## Late 1800s – First analogues 
Punch cards were developed by Herman Hollerith. They were used in early computers for data input and storage.  
Technology - Punch tape — continuous rolls of paper with holes encoding data. 
## 1930s–1950s  
Magnetic drum memory — first “reusable” electronic storage medium, precursor to magnetic disks. 
## 1950s–1970s Magnetic Revolution   
## 1956  
IBM 305 RAMAC —first hard disk drive (HDD); 5 MB capacity, 50 spinning disks, size of a wardrobe.  
Magnetic core memory (ferrite rings) — used in early mainframes; fast but expensive. 
Magnetic tape drives — cheaper, high capacity, sequential access; widely used for backups. 
## 1970s–1980s Miniaturization & Personal Computing Era  
Floppy disks (8", 5.25", 3.5") — portable, rewritable, symbolic early PCs. 
Compact cassette data storage — used in early home computers like the Commodore 64. 
Early HDD refinements — Winchester drives introduced sealed heads, improved reliability. 
## 1980s–1990s Optical and Solid-State Beginnings  
CD-ROM (1982) — digital optical storage for software and media. 
Magneto-optical drives — hybrid of magnetic and optical tech. 
Flash memory invention (1984 by Toshiba’s Fujio Masuoka) — set the foundation for modern SSDs and USBs. 
## 1990s–2000s Portable & Digital Age Expansion  
ZIP and JAZ drives (Iomega) — larger removable storage for personal users. 
USB flash drives (late 1990s) — small, durable, plug-and-play convenience. 
DVDs and Blu-Ray — higher-density optical storage for films, software, and backups. 
## 2000s–2010s  Solid-State Era  
SSD adoption — faster, silent, and more reliable than HDDs; initially expensive but prices dropped fast. 
Memory cards (SD, microSD) — dominant in phones, cameras, and handheld devices. 
Shift from mechanical to NAND-based flash — enabled ultrabooks, smartphones, tablets. 
## 2000s–2010s Cloud & Data-Center Storage 
Cloud computing — remote storage (Google Drive, AWS S3, OneDrive, etc.). 
NVMe and PCIe SSDs — ultra-fast interface replacing SATA. 
Hybrid drives and RAID arrays — balancing performance and reliability. 
Data redundancy, encryption, and sustainability — key modern focus. 
# Future Trends 
DNA data storage — experimental, extremely dense and durable. 
Holographic and quantum storage — potential breakthroughs for the next decades. 
Eco-friendly and recyclable materials — response to e-waste and energy use.
